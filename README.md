# web-scrapping
Module 11 Challenge

I used the started code provided for both part 1 and 2. To complete each step I referenced previous assignments, or web resources such as pandas documentation and Geek4Geeks to ensure I had the correct syntax for my codes.

The code for both parts are located in the "Start_Code" directory.

The CSV file is located in the home directory.
